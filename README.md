# CS741-Project

For the scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF and RR), the input is hardcoded into the programs. The process number, burst time and arrival time have been implemented as a list with 3-tuple elements (For e.g. [[0,3,1],[1,8,0]]). In the example  given, the list consists of two processes with burst/arrival time of 3/1 and 8/0 respectively. In case of round robin, the quantum slice have also been hardcoded into the program and can be changed as required. Inorder to relate the traditional operating system schedulers with the function schedulers in cloud, we can consider the burst time to be the function execution time and the turnaround time as the latency of function execution on the platform.

In both the hashing and consistent hashing algorithms, the inputs have been given as a list. The inputs in the programs are in the form of IP addresses. It is to be noted that the hash values will change with each re-execution of the programs due to the inbuilt hash function behaviour in Python. For a set of input, the hash values are computed and are mapped accordingly to the servers. The variable n0 corresponds to the number of servers available on the platform. In c_hashing.py, weight variable corresponds to the total capacity of the servers.
